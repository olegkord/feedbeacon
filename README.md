## What is feedBeacon?

feedBeacon is an app that connects hungry but indecisive people with restaurants that need seats.

### For the customer:

During account creation, the user selects a list of "likes." These "likes" can be food types (burgers, steak, etc.) restaurant qualities (sports bar, romantic, etc.) or activities (date night, night out, etc.).

After login, the likes are displayed on the user's page, and the user may add or remove them as he or she wishes. On a given user session, the user may select some "likes" and they will jump down to the bottom field and become a "need." Once all "needs" are selected, the user taps the "feed me" button and a notification is sent to all the restaurants who's tags match the user's "needs."

### For the restaurant:

Registering a restaurant is very similar to registering a user, but instead of a list of "likes" the restaurant specifies a list of "tags." On the restaurant's page, the restaurant may add or take away likes as it wishes.

During normal operation, the restaurant only needs to log in and listen for user requests. User requests get appended under the "reservations" field.
